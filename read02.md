# State and Props

What types of things can you pass in the props? 

We can pass values of any data type to propes.

What is the big difference between props and state?

 is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.

When do we re-render our application?

React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically. However, there may be cases where the render() method depends on some other data.

What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

In React, whenever we are working with any data, we always use state for storing that data which may be a string, number or any complex object.
