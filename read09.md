## What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

immediately testable.
maintaining and refactoring code much easier.
better quality code.
## What is immutability?

Immutability means that it can't be changed (unchangeable)


## What is Referential transparency?

Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior. (pure + immutability = referential transparency)




## What is a module?

Modules in Node.js are a set of functionalities that can be called whenever are needed.


## What does the word ‘require’ do?

It imports the data from a module, given it's path.


## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

We use require and give it a verable and equal it to whater the module exports from the other file



## What do we have to do to make a module available?

we have to export the module function
