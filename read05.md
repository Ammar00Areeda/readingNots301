# Putting it all together

## React Docs - Thinking in React

## What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a component can have only one cause to change. The Single Responsibility Principle states that the same functionality should not be duplicated in different places in the code, in simple terms.

## What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

If we construct a static version instead of using a dynamic data model, we must spend more time typing than thinking. And when it comes to incorporating interaction, we need to look beyond simply typing.

## Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

We need to add components and passing data as props

## What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

## How can you identify where state needs to live?

# Higher-Order Functions

## What is a “higher-order function”?

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them

## Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

This function creates a new one to see if the value returned is larger than the one passed in as an argument.

 at line 2, where it's used in order to compare the current value with the value supplied as an input.

 ## Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

 reduce in higher-order-functions builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value.
